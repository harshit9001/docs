## Overview

The WaterrAI API provides a comprehensive platform for creating and managing AI-powered conversation scenarios, personas, meetings, and analysis. This documentation covers the core concepts and endpoints you'll need to integrate WaterrAI into your application.

## Core Concepts

### Personas

A **Persona** represents an AI character with specific traits, background, and voice characteristics. Personas are reusable across multiple scenarios and define how the AI will behave and communicate.

**Key Features:**
- Define personality traits (demeanor, background, job title)
- Associate voice characteristics
- Reusable across multiple scenarios

**CRUD Operations:**
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete personas
- Get all personas or a specific persona by ID
- Filter personas by membership

### Scenarios

A **Scenario** is a conversation context that combines a persona with specific goals, prompts, and settings. Scenarios define what the conversation will be about and how it should be conducted.

**Key Features:**
- Link to a persona
- Define conversation goals and objectives
- Configure meeting controls (recording, transcription, etc.)
- Generate embeddable scenarios for public access

**CRUD Operations:**
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete scenarios
- Get scenario by ID (returns full data)
- Get scenario for embed (returns embed data for public scenarios)
- Scenarios can be public, restricted, or private

### Meetings

A **Meeting** is an active conversation session created from a scenario. When you create a meeting, you get a meeting room URL and token that can be used to join the conversation.

**Key Features:**
- Created from a scenario
- Returns meeting room URL and token
- Tracks meeting status and duration
- Links to recordings and transcripts

**Operations:**
- Create a meeting from a scenario
- Get meeting details by ID
- Update meeting status
- End a meeting

### Analysis

**Analysis** provides detailed insights about a meeting, including performance metrics, strengths, growth areas, and goal-based evaluations.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic analysis after meeting completion
- Goal-based scoring
- Speech pattern analysis (filler words, repetitions, etc.)
- Summary and recommendations

**Operations:**
- Get analysis by meeting ID
- Get analysis by analysis ID
- Get all analyses for a scenario

### Recordings

**Recordings** capture the audio/video of meetings for later review and analysis.

**Operations:**
- Get all recordings
- Get recording by ID
- Get recordings for a specific meeting

### Transcripts (Sentence Transcripts)

**Sentence Transcripts** provide a structured, sentence-by-sentence breakdown of meeting conversations. This is the recommended format for developers as it provides better structure and easier parsing.

**Key Features:**
- Sentence-level granularity
- Speaker identification
- Sequence numbering
- Timestamp information

**Operations:**
- Get all sentenced transcripts for a scenario
- Get sentenced transcripts for a specific meeting
- Get sentenced transcripts for a transcript ID

## API Structure

The API is organized into four main areas:

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication. You can use either **JWT tokens** or **API secrets** for authentication.

### JWT Tokens

JWT tokens are obtained through OAuth authentication and expire after a set period. Use them in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### API Secrets

API secrets are permanent credentials that never expire, ideal for server-to-server communication and automation. They are created through the API and can be revoked or reactivated as needed.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer wai_abc123def456...
```
